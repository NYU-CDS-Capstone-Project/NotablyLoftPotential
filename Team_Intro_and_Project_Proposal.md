## Team Members
#### Alex Simonoff
Works full time as a Data Scientist at Spotify (following a year and half in Analytics at Etsy). Has done extensive work in big data, data visualization, hypothesis testing and some NLP using python (in the Intro to Data Science Course). Studied mathematics undergrad at NYU graduating in 2013, worked in Risk Management and Data Science at AIG an insurance company for 2 and a half years until joining Etsy and now Spotify. She started the CDS Master’s program in September 2015 and is hoping to do a bit more work with NLP and machine learning.

#### Rob Hammond
Works full time as a Senior Analyst at Risk Management Solutions, Inc working on catastrophe risk modeling and data visualization. He studied mathematics at Saint Michael’s College in Vermont, graduating in 2013. Before joining RMS he worked with Scotch Whisky in Edinburgh, Scotland. Since starting his MS degree at CDS he has worked with NLP via TensorFlow applications of NN modeling, data visualization, and various other machine learning techniques.


We chose to work together because we worked together in the machine learning course in the spring, and had a good amount of collaboration with differing perspectives. We both share an interest in using NLP to understand society, politics and morality and are hoping to find a project that will tie into our shared interest. Additionally, we both work full time, and are familiar with each other’s time commitments and can very easily accommodate each other’s schedules.


## Project Choices
Ideally, we would like to work with the NYU Van Bavel Lab on their Twitter NLP project to measure how the presence of moral and emotional framing of political messages affects engagement on social media. They specified they were looking to work with 1-2 students as the problem is well defined and as we are a group of two aiming to work with this project we believe it would be a good fit. We would enjoy working with language data and indicators of post popularity via NLP and machine learning techniques (such as clustering and naive bayes) in an attempt to segment tweets by similar language and dive into the language to parse out moral emotions.

Our second choice (though we would much prefer working with the Van Bavel Lab) would be working with NYU Langone on predicting undiagnosed diseases from electronic health records and medical notes. We will likely try to use some NLP in this project to dive into medical notes, as well as machine learning techniques to develop predictions using the NLP results as predictors.

Our last choice if either of these are not possible for us to tackle would be to develop a robust framework for determining statistically significant difference between two time series (with a goal of being used for hypothesis testing) and implement it in python. The end goal would be to create an open source package, and I have several connections with professors in Stern’s IOMS department who would likely be up for mentoring on the statistical front.
